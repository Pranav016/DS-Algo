These are some DS- Algo questions that you will see on each and every coding platform but aren't as directly available on he internet unlike the insertion, deletion programs that will be easily available everywhere, hence they haven't been added in this repo.

To set up the environment for this repository, I would recommend Code Blocks IDE which you can download from this link- https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/

You can also run the code on a ready to go online IDE wihout any hastle of downloading anything. I would recommend the online IDE- ideone because I feel that it is seamless and fast.

To use a text editor for your compilation purpose, you can download MinGW compiler and connect it to the text editor of your choice.
